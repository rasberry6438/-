Emuera_lazyloading.exe loads the game quicker, and uses less RAM than the regular executable.
A table file named lazyloading.dat will be created during the first lazy loading startup.
Be sure to delete this file when updating from an older version to avoid any related issues.
************

This executable doesn't have any known issues so far, except for a false positive of a failed loading during startup.
Please report any bugs you find with it to AnonTW's issue page.
