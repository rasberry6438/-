DISCLAIMER: I'm not english naitive speaker, so expect a lot of grammatical mistakes and misspellings which I didn't notice. I didn't test this dialogue too much, there could be bugs. Please report them so I can fix them.

You can always dm or ping me on Era Games General or eraNAS General Discord.

About this
==========

• I chosen Rin Satsuki as my first try in writing. Since she is "non-existant" character, I guess no one would be mad about her personality. She doesn't have any canon personality, but I picked the most common theories about her.

• Her dialogue was written with idea in mind that MC is young adult male human Outsider.
 
• She is a nurse, a kirin and mostly depicted with an erhu (chinese string instrument).

• There's no Lust route and I don't have plans for it for now.

• Originated from China, since it's where kirins come from. She is old and follows teachings of Confucius.

• Personality: polite, kind, cares too much about other people's health.

• At yearning stage she will start being more open to you and act sometimes as unexperienced schoolgirl near her first crush.

• At love stage she will become clingy waifu

• There's not much sex lines
